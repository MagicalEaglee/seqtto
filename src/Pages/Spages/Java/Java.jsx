            <p>JavaTM stands out as a versatile and object-oriented programming language. When you write Java code, it transforms into an intermediate bytecode that smoothly operates on a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Noteworthy is the fact that JVMs cater to a diverse range of hardware, spanning from PCs to servers and even mainframes. This intrinsic flexibility ensures the portability of Java code across various platforms.</p>

            <h3>Preferred Platform for Enterprise Development</h3>
            <p>Java Enterprise Edition has consistently held its position as the go-to development platform for crafting enterprise applications. The foundation of basic Java web applications involves the utilization of JSP, JSTL, servlets, JDBC, and Java Beans. As applications grow in complexity, the demand for features like fault tolerance, infrastructure for distributed components, and transaction support becomes apparent. This requirement is met by application servers, with open-source options like JBoss gaining widespread acclaim.</p>
