                    <p>Node.js is a developer platform built on Googleâ€™s V8 JavaScript engine. It aggregates the qualities of other server-side languages to produce an irresistible package that is also modular, accessible, and concise.</p>
                    <p>In the dynamic landscape of modern software development, the demand for real-time, high-performance applications is ever-growing. At seqtto, we specialize in harnessing the full potential of Node.js to propel your projects to new heights.</p>

                        <p>Node.js is a good choice for applications that require real time communication between users, clients, and servers across the web. It can power the back-end of real-time collaboration software and easily scale up to support very large number of users.</p>

                        <h3>Non-blocking Input/Output</h3>
                        <p>Real-time communication requires fast, non-blocking input/output (I/O). In Node.js, the non-blocking I/O is based on an event loop and uses asynchronous callbacks for I/O. All I/O intensive tasks are passed to this event loop which efficiently manages asynchronous operations. This non-blocking programming model allows you to work with network traffic with a lower server footprint.</p>
